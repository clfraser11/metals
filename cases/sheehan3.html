      <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
Many people today are looking for methods to improve their physical appearances. From cosmetic surgery to botox injections science is constantly expanding the ways to transform one&rsquo;s natural appearance. What happened to &ldquo;good old fashion makeup&rdquo; and is it any less dangerous than these more radical solutions? In the past year, NPD conducted an online study of 5,657 women between the ages 18-64 to determine the percent that wore makeup, and discovered that 84 percent of the group did wear makeup.(1) Mintel market research group, in 2004, conducted a similar study and found that 70 percent of French women wore makeup.2 Studies have also shown that Hispanic women are more likely to wear makeup, and that the percentage of women who wear makeup changes with age.(2) So why is it more than a marketing concern that a larger percent of persons of every ethnicity (about 86-87) wear makeup? What women do not know about their concealers is that besides hiding their flaws the products have hidden dangers. What makes the cosmetics so beautiful and makes them work so well are the same ingredients that are toxic and cancerous to humans.</p>
      <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
      <p>Make-up is far from a new fashion trend and the toxicity of the product is as old as the tradition.(3) &nbsp;The ancient Egyptians used mercury based face powder, and during the Elizabethan era the ladies of the court used arsenic face powder to create the desired snow white skin.(3) In 1933, one woman was blinded by &ldquo;Lash Lure&rdquo; and another died from its application. In 1938, &ldquo;Kormelu,&rdquo; a depilatory cream, was being sold with the active ingredient thallium acetate.(3) Thallium acetate is used to kill rats and was known to cause baldness, pain, and paralysis.(3) A study done at the University of California revealed that people working in the cosmetics field were four times as likely to have multiple myeloma (a malignant bone tumor).(3) Below is a tabulated version of several common cosmetic products, the harmful ingredient, the purpose for incorporating the chemical, and the adverse effect. So why is this still going on today when we know so much more about the effects? Unfortunately cosmetics are a low priority because of they are assumed to not be harmful.(3) The assumption is mainly based on the theory that skin will block absorption, but since many drugs are delivered in patch form this hypothesis should be revisited.(3) Most cosmetics are not tested for more than an acute allergic reaction, and that consumers stop usage of makeups when they show a reaction. Testing for effects of chronic use is expensive and rarely done. In 1938, the U.S Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was enacted and in 1977 a mandatory ingredient list on packaging was added to the act.(3) But how can a consumer know what is harmful and what is not since few cosmetics have warnings? In addition, a review of the labeling as regulated by the Cosmetic Act shows it to be insufficient for the average consumer.(5) The act requires that labels be placed on products that are harmful, and these can be seen on hair dyes, eye shadow, and mascara. However, since the research is limited to short term and acute effects of toxins no label has to be made for the long term effects. </p>

      <p><strong>Dangers</strong><br />
        The dangers of cosmetics are numerous since such a variety of chemicals go into the various types of makeup to make it shiny, long lasting, or smudge proof. Below are various types of hazardous materials found in different types of makeup. </p>

      <p>Many other chemicals that are put into cosmetics are only mildly toxic; however some play a role in the uptake of these more toxic ones. Since often the desired outcome is absorption, many manufacturers will add chemicals that aid in the absorption of there product through the skin such as boron nitrate.(8) There are countless other toxic chemicals present in cosmetics, if you are concerned <a href="http://www.cosmeticdatabase.com/research/">cosmetic safety database</a> will help you to determine how harmful the products you are that you are using.</p>
